# SpotiDown
SpotiDown is a python based program that downloads your spotify music playlists even without a premium subscription from youtube. You can download any public playlist with just the username of the creator, as well as any of your playlists and liked songs by granting access to the app.

*Right now you can only use this by creating your own app in spotify web developer and putting your client id and secret to a .env file
